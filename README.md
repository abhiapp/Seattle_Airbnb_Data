### Project Objective <a name="objective"></a>
My goal is to analyze the Seattle Airbnb data for 2016â€“17 to find an interesting pattern, that can be useful for hosts and travelers.I want to answer a few questions while analyzing data that can be very useful for hosts and travelers.


#### Questions for Hosts:
- Which neighborhoods in Seattle have very high demand and are good for investment and renting the property?
- What is the peak month to rent in Seattle?
